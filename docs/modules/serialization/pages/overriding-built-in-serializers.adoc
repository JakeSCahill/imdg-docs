= Overriding the Built-in Serializers

As mentioned in the previous page, you cannot override the built-in serializers by default.
Yet, you can use `allowOverrideDefaultSerializers` when using programmatic configuration or
`allow-override-default-serializers` when using the declarative one to specify whether the built-in
serializers will be overridden:

SerializationConfig{
  boolean isAllowOverrideDefaultSerializers();
 
  SerializationConfig setAllowOverrideDefaultSerializers(final boolean allowOverrideDefaultSerializers);}

You should use this configuration cautiously. Built-in serializers are used
heavily by the Hazelcast internally.  If any of the instances in a cluster overrides
a built-in serializer, all the members and clients in that cluster must override it with the same serializer. 
This configuration is specifically for the following cases:

* You implement a a custom serialization configuration by the user for a type
* Hazelcast adds a built-in serializer for the same type in a future release.

To be able to support rolling upgrade from an old version, you need to make sure of
the backward compatibility of the serialization. As a solution, you can set this property on
the new version so that the new instances can override the new built-in serializers with
their existing custom ones.
