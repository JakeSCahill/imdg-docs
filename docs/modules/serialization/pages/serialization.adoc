= Serialization
:description: To be able to send data over a network between cluster members and/or clients, you have to serialize it into raw bytes. Hazelcast has many serialization methods to choose from, depending on which Hazelcast topology you are using and what you plan on doing with your data.

{description}

== Serialization in Client/Server Mode

In xref:overview:topology.adoc[client/server mode], you can serialize your data on the client side and/or the xref:ROOT:glossary.adoc#member[member] (server) side.

If you just want to store data on members, clients can handle serialization without the members needing to know how to do so. For example, you can serialize data as JSON and add it to a map. Then you can later request that information and deserialize on the client.

However, in the following cases, you must configure members to be able to serialize and deserialize your data:

[cols="a,a,a,a"]
|===
|Case|Clients|Reason|Exceptions

|When the data structure's values are xref:data-structures:map.adoc#setting-in-memory-format[stored as objects]
|All clients
|Members must be able to serialize or deserialize the object in order to send it to other members or receive it from other members
|

|When you want to xref:computing:entry-processor.adoc[process map entries] or use an xref:computing:executor-service.adoc[executor service]
|All clients
|Members need to serialize the tasks
|When using the Java client with xref:implementing-portable-serialization.adoc[`Portable`] serialization, you don't need to configure serialization on the member. For details, see xref:clusters:accessing-domain-objects.adoc[].

|When you use xref:sql:querying-imap.adoc#key-and-value-fields[SQL queries on nested fields] whose values are not primitives
|Java only
|Members need to deserialize underlying objects to be able to read nested fields
|You can query nested fields whose values are primitives because these data types are serialized by Hazelcast by default. See << data-types-with-built-in-serialization, Data Types with Built-In Serialization>>

=== Serialization Options for Clients

The following serialization options are available for clients:

- IdentifiedDataSerializable
- Portable
- Custom Serialization

For a comparison of these options, see xref:comparing-interfaces.adoc[].

== Serialization in Embedded Mode

In xref:overview:topology.adoc[embedded mode], because data is partitioned across members in a cluster, each member must be able to serialize and deserialize data in the following cases:

- Adding key/value objects to a map

- Putting items in a queue/set/list

- Sending a runnable using an executor service

- Processing an entry within a map

- Locking an object

- Sending a message to a topic

=== Serialization Options for Members

For a full list of serialization options, see xref:comparing-interfaces.adoc[].

== Data Types with Built-In Serialization

By default, Hazelcast optimizes the serialization for the following data types. You do not need to serialize or deserialize these types yourself:

* `Byte`, `Boolean`, `Character`, `Short`, `Integer`, `Long`, `Float`, `Double`, `String`, `UUID`
* `byte[]`, `boolean[]`, `char[]`, `short[]`, `int[]`, `long[]`, `float[]`, `double[]`, `String[]`
* `Class`, `Optional`, `Date`, `BigInteger`, `BigDecimal`, `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList/Set`, `HashMap/Set`,
`ConcurrentSkipListMap/Set`, `ConcurrentHashMap`, `LinkedHashMap/Set`, `TreeMap/Set`, `ArrayDeque`, `LinkedBlockingQueue`,
`ArrayBlockingQueue`, `PriorityBlockingQueue`, `PriorityQueue`, `DelayQueue`, `SynchronousQueue`, `LinkedTransferQueue`

If you would rather implement your own serialization for these types, see xref:overriding-built-in-serializers.adoc[Overriding the Default Serializers].
