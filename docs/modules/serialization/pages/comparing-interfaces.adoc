= Comparing Serialization Interfaces

The table below provides a comparison between the interfaces listed in the previous section
to help you in deciding which interface to use in your applications.

|===
| Serialization Interface| Advantages| Disadvantages

| Serializable
| * A standard and basic Java interface

* Requires no implementation
| * More time and CPU usage

* More space occupancy

* Supported only by members and Java clients

| Externalizable
| * A standard Java interface

* More CPU and memory usage efficient than Serializable
| * Serialization interface must be implemented

* Supported only by members and Java clients

| DataSerializable
| * More CPU and memory usage efficient than Serializable
| * Specific to Hazelcast

*  Supported only by members and Java clients

| IdentifiedDataSerializable
| * More CPU and memory usage efficient than Serializable

* Reflection is not used during deserialization

* Supported by members and all clients
| * Specific to Hazelcast

* Serialization interface must be implemented

* A Factory and configuration must be implemented

| Portable
| * More CPU and memory usage efficient than Serializable

* Reflection is not used during deserialization

* Versioning is supported

* Partial deserialization is supported during Queries

* Supported by members and all clients
| * Specific to Hazelcast

* Serialization interface must be implemented

* A Factory and configuration must be implemented

* Class definition is also sent with data but stored only once per class

| Custom Serialization
| * Does not require class to implement an interface

* Convenient and flexible

* Can be based on StreamSerializer ByteArraySerializer
|* Serialization interface must be implemented

* Plug in and configuration is required
