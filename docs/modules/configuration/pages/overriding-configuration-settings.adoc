= Overriding Configuration
[[overriding-configuration]]

You can override your clusters' configurations
without having to modify the XML or YAML configuration files.
Hazelcast makes this possible using the system properties or
environment variables.

For example, if you just want to override `cluster-name`,
you would need to craft a declarative configuration as follows:

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    <cluster-name name="dev"/>
</hazelcast>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  cluster-name: dev
----
====

Instead of the above, you can achieve the same purpose using
the following on the command line:

[tabs] 
==== 
Using Environment Variable:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,shell]
----
export HZ_CLUSTERNAME=dev
----
--

Using System Property::
+
[source,shell]
----
java -Dhz.cluster-name=value
----
====

Recognized and unrecognized configuration entries will be logged when Hazelcast starts.

When overriding the configuration provided in a custom file,
remember to overwrite the whole configuration sections at once;
if you don't, the remaining entries will be set to their default values.

NOTE: The above mechanism exists mostly for the sake of trivial
environment specific configuration changes, and should not be treated
as a replacement for complex XML/YAML configuration files.

== Conversion Rules

NOTE: All entries need to mirror YAML configuration structure which differs slightly from XML's.

In order to make Hazelcast recognize environment variables
as valid configuration entries, they need to obey the following rules:

* Each configuration entry needs to start with `HZ_` or `HZ_CLIENT_`.
* A new configuration level should be introduced with an underscore (`_`).
* Dashes (`-`) should be removed.
* Variable names should be in upper case.

Assume that you want to have the following configuration for
your cluster, represented as YAML:

[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  cluster-name: dev
  network:
    port:
      auto-increment: true
      port-count: 100
      port: 5701
    join:
      auto-detection:
        enabled: true
----

If you want to use the environment variables, the above
would be represented as a set of the following environment variables:

[source,shell]
----
HZ_CLUSTERNAME=dev
HZ_NETWORK_PORT_AUTOINCREMENT=true
HZ_NETWORK_PORT_PORTCOUNT=100
HZ_NETWORK_PORT_PORT=5701
HZ_NETWORK_JOIN_AUTODETECTION_ENABLED=true
----

In order to make Hazelcast recognize system properties
as valid configuration entries, they need to obey the following rules:

* Each configuration entry needs to start with `hz.` or `hz-client.`.
* A new configuration level should be introduced with an underscore (`_`).
* Variable names should be in lower case.

If you want to use the environment variables, the above YAML
configuration would be represented as a set of the following system
properties:

[source,shell]
----
hz.cluster-name=dev
hz.network.port.auto-increment=true
hz.network.port_port-count=100
hz.network.port_port=5701
hz.network.join-auto-detection-enabled=true
----

WARNING: Keep in mind that it's not possible to override
configuration entries using YAML sequences.
