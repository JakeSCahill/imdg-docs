You can see the features for all Hazelcast IMDG editions in the following
architecture diagram.

NOTE: You can see small "HD" boxes for some features in the above diagram.
Those features can use High-Density (HD) Memory Store when it is available.
It means if you have Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD, you can use those features with HD Memory Store.
