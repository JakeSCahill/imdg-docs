= SQL on Data Structures Backed by High-Density Memory Store

If you configure the `IMap` data structure to use
xref:storage:high-density-memory.adoc#configuring-high-density-memory-store[High-Density Memory Store], you have to
create at least one global High-Density Memory Store index to run an SQL statement.
This limitation comes from the fact that off-heap `IMap` data structure is not
thread-safe, and we use thread-safe concurrent indexes based on the B+ Tree implementation
to run ``IMap``s scan operators.
