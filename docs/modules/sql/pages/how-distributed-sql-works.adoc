= How Distributed SQL Works

When an SQL statement is submitted for execution, the SQL service parses and
optimizes it using Apache Calcite. The result is an executable plan that
is cached and reused by subsequent executions of the same statement.

The plan contains a tree of query fragments. A query fragment is a tree of
operators that could be executed on a single member independently. Child
fragments supply data to parent fragments, possibly over a network, until
the root fragment is reached. The root fragment returns the query results.
