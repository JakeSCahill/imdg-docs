= Phone Homes

Hazelcast uses phone home data to learn about the
usage of Hazelcast IMDG.

Hazelcast IMDG member instances call our phone
home server initially when they are started and
then every 24 hours. This applies to all the instances
joined to the cluster.

**What is sent in?**

The following information is sent in a phone home:

* Hazelcast IMDG version
* Local Hazelcast IMDG member UUID
* Download ID
* A hash value of the cluster ID
* Cluster size bands for 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 100, 150, 300, 600 and > 600
* Number of connected clients bands of 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 100, 150, 300, 600 and > 600
* Number of clients by language (Java, C++, C#)
* Cluster uptime
* Member uptime
* Environment Information:
** Name of operating system
** Kernel architecture (32-bit or 64-bit)
** Version of operating system
** Version of installed Java
** Name of Java Virtual Machine
* Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise specific:
** Flag for Hazelcast Enterprise
** Hash value of license key
** Native memory usage

**Disabling Phone Homes**

Set the `hazelcast.phone.home.enabled` system property to
false either in the config
or on the Java command line. See the
xref:system-properties.adoc[System Properties appendix] for information on how to set a property.

You can also disable the phone home using the environment variable `HZ_PHONE_HOME_ENABLED`.

Simply add the following line to your `.bash_profile`:

```
export HZ_PHONE_HOME_ENABLED=false
```
